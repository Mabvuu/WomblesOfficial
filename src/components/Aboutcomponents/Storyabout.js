        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>The predeccesor of the current venue was created in 1984, when husband-and-wife team Duncan and Yvette Barker
        started off in what is now Sam Levy's Villag, moving in 1988 to the Ballantyne Park Shopping centre. In the 2000s
      , they decided to move to Australia and 2 years later returned to africa. They settled in Gauteng and opened a restaurant also formerly known as Wombles.
    </p>
      <p>The couple decided to coe back home in 2020 and met up with
      Andrew Mama, owner of a successful upmarket restaurant called Amanzi, situated
    in the area where the Chisipite and Highlands surburbs meet. The Barkers being experienced
  restaurateurs, took over and rebranded a new venue called Wombles Khaya Nyama - the
latter words meaning 'House of meat' in shona.</p>
          <h2>The Present</h2>
          <p>After opening Wombles, the youngest of their four daughters, Tiffany has been well trained in the trade by her father, Ducan.
          She keeps a special eye micro-managing the kitchen activity. Duncan unfortuately passed in 2021,
        leaving behind a distraught family but one that railed and carries on as a mother-and-daughter team of Yvette and Tiffany.
      </p>
        <p>Yvette is in charge of front house and is getting to know an expanding clientele
        , while Tiffany focuses on kitchen and personally inspects everything heading out to tables.
      Ducan would be proud!</p>
