            Wombles is a restaurant renowned as a fine-dining steakhouse in Harare, Zimbabwe.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
            It is a fine dining restaurant and features an excellent menu and wine list, with prices
            commensurate with expectations from an A-list venue. At the core of the menu is a steakhouse heart,
            but with a wide selection of other dishes, including vegetarian optionsâ€”making it both varied
            and interesting to folk looking for non-beef content.
